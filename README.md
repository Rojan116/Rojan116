# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries required to run the code here beyond the *[Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) of *[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. I used python 3.7 during the project.
