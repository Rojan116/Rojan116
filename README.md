# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries required to run the code here beyond the *[Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) of *[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. I used python 3.7 during the project.

# Project Motivation
In this project, I choose [Stackoverflow Survay , 2019](ttps://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) data to analayse and understand following questions.

* What are the most used programming languages in 2019?
* What are the most popular web Framework in 2019? 
* What are the Popular Developer types in 2019? 
* Women's Participation in programming in 2019?

# File Description
The data are taken from [Stackoverflow's 2019 Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)

# Result 
we took a look at what were the most popular programming languages, popular web framework, developers type, and women’s particiation, according to Stackoverflow’s 2019 Annual Developer Survey data.
* we see that Javascript is the most popular programming language in 2019
* JQuery is the most popular web framework followed by react.js and angular.js
